# Question 1.17 #

Some computer systems do not provide a privileged mode of operation
in hardware. Is it possible to construct a secure operating system for
these computer systems? Give arguments both that it is and that it is
not possible.

# Answer #

- By mean of secure operating system, it prevents unauthorized access to the system and its resources. 

- We can still construct a secure operating system for these computer systems without a privileged mode of operation in hardware by:
- Only allowing users to program in a high-level language, which is then compiled into machine language by a compiler. This way, the user cannot directly access the hardware.
