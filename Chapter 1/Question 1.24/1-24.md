Describe some of the challenges of designing operating systems for
mobile devices compared with designing operating systems for traditional PCs

# Answer #

Some of the challenges of designing operating systems for mobile devices compared with designing operating systems for traditional PCs are:

- **Limited resources**: Mobile devices have limited resources compared to traditional PCs. This includes limited processing power, memory, and battery life. Operating systems for mobile devices need to be optimized to run efficiently on these limited resources.

- **Small screen size**: Mobile devices have smaller screen sizes compared to traditional PCs. This means that the user interface of the operating system needs to be designed to work well on small screens and touch input.

- **Low battery life**: Mobile devices are powered by batteries, which have limited capacity. Operating systems for mobile devices need to be designed to minimize power consumption to extend battery life.
