# Question 1.13 #

Consider a computing cluster consisting of two nodes running a
database. Describe two ways in which the cluster software can manage
access to the data on the disk. Discuss the benefits and disadvantages
of each.

# Answer #

In a computing cluster consisting of two nodes running a database, the cluster software can manage access to the data on the disk in two main ways:

## 1. Asymmetric Clustering

- **Description:**  
  In asymmetric clustering, one node (server) runs the database application and handles all requests, while the other node merely monitors it. If the active node fails, the monitoring node takes over as the active server.

- **Benefits:**
  - **High Availability:** If the primary node fails, the backup node automatically takes over, ensuring continuous service without disruption.
  - **Simple to Implement:** This approach is straightforward to set up and manage.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - **Underutilization of Resources:** Only one node is actively handling the database, so the second node is underused.
  - **Suboptimal Performance:** The standby node is idle, and its resources are not being utilized efficiently.

## 2. Parallel Clustering

- **Description:**  
  In parallel clustering, both nodes run the database application and handle requests simultaneously. The data is shared between the nodes, and both nodes have concurrent access to the database.

- **Benefits:**
  - **Improved Performance:** Both nodes process requests concurrently, improving the overall system performance.
  - **Full Utilization of Resources:** Both nodes contribute to processing, maximizing the use of available resources and enhancing scalability.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - **Complex to Implement:** A distributed locking mechanism is needed to ensure that no two nodes access or modify the same data simultaneously, preventing conflicts or data corruption.
  - **More Complex Management:** Synchronizing data access and load balancing between the nodes makes system management more complicated.

Both methods have their advantages and drawbacks. The choice between them depends on the system's performance requirements, availability needs, and management complexity.
