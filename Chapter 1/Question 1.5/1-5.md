# Question 1.5 #

How does the distinction between kernel mode and user mode function
as a rudimentary form of protection (security)?

# Answer #

So the distinction between kernel mode and user mode have the following functions:

-Prevent inexperienced users from damaging the system. In user mode, users can only access a limited set of resources, and they cannot access the kernel mode, which is the core of the operating system. This prevents inexperienced users from damaging the system.

-Prevent malicious software from damaging the system. In user mode, malicious software can only access a limited set of resources, and they cannot access the kernel mode, which is the core of the operating system. This prevents malicious software from damaging the system.
