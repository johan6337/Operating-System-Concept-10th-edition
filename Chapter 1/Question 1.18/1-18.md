# Question 1.18 # 

Many SMP systems have different levels of caches; one level is local to
each processing core, and another level is shared among all processing
cores. Why are caching systems designed this way?

# Answer #

The reason for having multiple levels of caches is to reduce the latency of memory access. The local cache is faster than the shared cache, but it is also smaller. The local cache is used to store the most frequently accessed data, while the shared cache is used to store data that is shared among multiple processing cores. This design allows the system to take advantage of the speed of the local cache while still providing a large cache for shared data.
