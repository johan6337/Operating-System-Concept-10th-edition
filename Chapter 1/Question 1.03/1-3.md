# Question 1.3 #

What is the main difficulty that a programmer must overcome in writing
an operating system for a real-time environment?

# Answer #

The main difficulty in writting an operating system is everye task and process must be completed in a constraint deadline of time. If the task is not completed in time, it will cause the system to fail. This is a big challenge for the programmer to overcome.

There are two types of real-time operating systems:

- **Hard real-time systems**: In this system, the task must be completed within a strict deadline. If the task is not completed in time, it will cause the system to fail. For example, the system that controls the airbag in a car must respond within a few milliseconds to prevent injury to the passengers.

- **Soft real-time systems**: In this system, the task must be completed within a certain time frame. If the task is not completed in time, it will not cause the system to fail. For example, the system that controls the video streaming service must deliver the video within a certain time frame to ensure smooth playback.
