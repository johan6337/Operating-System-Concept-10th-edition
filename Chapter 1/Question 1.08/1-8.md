# Question 1.8 #

Some CPUs provide for more than two modes of operation. What are two
possible uses of these multiple modes

# Answer #

- Hypervisor mode: This mode is used to run a hypervisor, which is a virtualization software that allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine. The hypervisor runs in a privileged mode and controls the allocation of resources to the guest operating systems.

- Secure mode: This mode is used to run security-sensitive applications, such as encryption software or secure communication software. The secure mode provides additional security features, such as memory protection and access control, to protect the sensitive data from unauthorized access.
