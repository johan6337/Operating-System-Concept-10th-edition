# Question 1.25 #

What are some advantages of peer-to-peer systems over clientâ€“server
systems?

# Answer #

The most important advantage of peer-to-peer systems over client-server systems is that they prevent bottlenecks. In a client-server system, the server can become a bottleneck if it is overloaded with requests. In a peer-to-peer system, the load is distributed among all the peers, so no single peer becomes a bottleneck. This makes peer-to-peer systems more scalable than client-server systems.
