# Question 1.21 #

Discuss, with examples, how the problem of maintaining coherence of
cached data manifests itself in the following processing environments:

- a. Single-processor systems
- b. Multiprocessor systems
- c. Distributed systems

# Answer #

- In single-processor systems, there are no cache coherence issues because there is only one processor. The processor can read and write data from memory without worrying about other processors modifying the data in their caches.
