What are the three main purposes of an operating system?

# Answer #

Operating system has 3 main purposes:

- **Manage hardware resources**: The OS acts as an intermediary between hardware and software, managing hardware resources such as the CPU, I/O devices, and memory. It ensures that each process receives the necessary resources without interfering with others.

- **User Interface**: The OS provides interfaces such as the GUI (Graphical User Interface) in Windows or the CLI (Command Line Interface) in Linux, which help users work effectively and easily solve problems with their computers.

- **Manage and control application**: The OS acts a role as traffic cotroller in order to manage different process, running apps in appropriate order. That no process interfere others.
