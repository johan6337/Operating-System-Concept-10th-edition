# Question 1.15 #

Explain how the Linux kernel variables HZ and jiffies can be used to
determine the number of seconds the system has been running since it
was booted.

# Answer #

- The Linux kernel uses two variables, hz and jiffies, to keep track of the number of clock ticks that have occurred since the system was booted. These variables can be used to determine the number of seconds that the system has been running.

- hz is a constant that represents the number of clock ticks per second on the system. On most systems, the value of hz is set to 1000. This means that the system clock generates 1000 clock ticks per second.

- jiffies is a variable that counts the number of clock ticks that have occurred since the system was booted. The value of jiffies is updated by the system clock every time a clock tick occurs.

- We can calculate the time elapsed by the formular: $$\text{time} = \frac{jiffies}{hz}$$
