# Question 1.22 #

Describe a mechanism for enforcing memory protection in order to
prevent a program from modifying the memory associated with other
programs

# Answer #

Most modern processors have a memory management unit (MMU) that provide the OS the ability to create protected separate memory sections for each process including a separate stack for each process. With the help of the MMU the processor can restrict each process to modifying / accessing only memory that has been allocated to it. This prevents one process from writing into a another processes memory space.
