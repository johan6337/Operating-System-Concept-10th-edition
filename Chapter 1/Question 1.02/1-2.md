# Question 1.2 #

We have stressed the need for an operating system to make efficient use
of the computing hardware. When is it appropriate for the operating
system to forsake this principle and to “waste” resources? Why is such
a system not really wasteful?

# Answer #

I think OS will waste computer resource than usual when users want to improve computer performance or want to run specific application more smoothly. It is a good thing cuz it will enhance user experience. For example, when you run a game, the OS will allocate more CPU and memory to the game to make it run more smoothly. This is not wasteful because it is what users want.
