# Question 1.12 #

How do clustered systems differ from multiprocessor systems? What is
required for two machines belonging to a cluster to cooperate to provide
a highly available service?

# Answer #

- Clustered systems is the system of multiprocessor computer that are connected to each other through a network and commute with each other by message while multiprocessor system is a invidual computer that have multiple processor that has multiple core share the same memory.

- The requirement for two machines belonging to a cluster to cooperate to provide a highly available service is that they must be synchronized and their data must be consistent. In case the main computer fails, the backup computer must take over the service without any interruption.
