# Question 1.16 #

Direct memory access is used for high-speed I/O devices in order to
avoid increasing the CPUâ€™s execution load.

- a. How does the CPU interface with the device to coordinate the
transfer?
- b. How does the CPU know when the memory operations are complete?
- c. The CPU is allowed to execute other programs while the DMA
controller is transferring data. Does this process interfere with
the execution of the user programs? If so, describe what forms of
interference are caused

# Answer #

- a. To initiate a DMA transfer, the CPU first sets up the DMA registers, which contain a pointer 
to the source of a transfer, a pointer to the destination of the transfer, and a counter of the number of 
bytes to be transferred. Then the DMA controller proceeds to place addresses on the bus to perform 
transfers, while the CPU is available to accomplish other work. 
- b. Once the entire transfer is finished, the DMA controller interrupts the CPU. 
- c. Both the CPU and the DMA controller are bus masters. A problem would be created if both the 
CPU and the DMA controller want to access the memory at the same time. Accordingly, the CPU 
should be momentarily prevented from accessing main memory when the DMA controller seizes the 
memory bus. However, if the CPU is still allowed to access data in its primary and secondary caches, 
a coherency issue may be created if both the CPU and the DMA controller update the same memory 
locations.
