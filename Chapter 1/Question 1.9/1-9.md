# Question 1.9 #

Timers could be used to compute the current time. Provide a short
description of how this could be accomplished.

# Answer #

- Choose a reference point in time, such as the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).
- Count the number of seconds elapsed since the reference point. This can be done by using the oscillator frequency of the system clock. That if the oscillator frequency is 1 MHz, then the number of seconds elapsed is equal to the number of clock ticks divided by 1,000,000. So we can use the formula `time = clock_ticks / frequency`.
