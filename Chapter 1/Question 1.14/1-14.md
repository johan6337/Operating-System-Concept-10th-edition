# Question 1.14 #

What is the purpose of interrupts? How does an interrupt differ from a
trap? Can traps be generated intentionally by a user program? If so, for
what purpose?

# Answer #

- Interrupts are used to handle asynchronous events that occur during the execution of a program. They are used to signal the CPU that an event has occurred that requires immediate attention. The CPU will then stop executing the current program and execute the interrupt handler.

- An interrupt differs from a trap in that an interrupt is used to handle asynchronous events, while a trap is used to handle synchronous events. An interrupt is generated by hardware, while a trap is generated by software.

- Traps can be generated intentionally by a user program. They can be used to signal the operating system that an error has occurred, or to request a service from the operating system. Ex: system calss or when u r playing game and u press ALT+TAB to switch to another program.
