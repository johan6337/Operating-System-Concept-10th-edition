# Question 1.4 #

Keeping in mind the various definitions of operating system, consider
whether the operating system should include applications such as web
browsers and mail programs. Argue both that it should and that it
should not, and support your answers

# Answer #

So we discuss 2 aspect of this question:

- **Advantages**:
- Making the operating system more beginner-friendly, cuz web browers and mail is the most common application that people use. So if the operating system includes these applications, it will be more convenient for the user.
- Making the operating system more competitive to other operating systems. For example, Windows and MacOS have their own web browsers and mail programs, so if the operating system includes these applications, it will be more competitive to other operating systems.

- **Disadvantages**:
- Use more hardware resources, and in some cases, users want another web browser or mail program, so it will be a waste of hardware resources.
- Concerns about monopoly: You can read this for more information about this disadvantage: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.)
