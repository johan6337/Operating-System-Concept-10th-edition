# Question 1.10 #

Give two reasons why caches are useful. What problems do they solve?
What problems do they cause? If a cache can be made as large as the 
device for which it is caching (for instance, a cache as large as a disk),
why not make it that large and eliminate the device?

# Answer #

- Two reasons why caches are useful:
- **Improve performance**: Caches store frequently accessed data and instructions closer to the processor, reducing the time it takes to access them. This improves the performance of the system by reducing the latency of memory accesses.
- **Reduce the bottleneck**: Caches reduce the bottleneck between the processor and the main memory by storing frequently accessed data and instructions closer to the processor. This reduces the number of memory accesses and the time it takes to access the data, improving the overall performance of the system.

- Problems that caches solve:
- **Reduce memory latency**: Caches reduce the latency of memory accesses by storing frequently accessed data and instructions closer to the processor. This reduces the time it takes to access the data and improves the performance of the system.

- Problems that caches cause:
- **Cache coherence**: Caches introduce the problem of cache coherence, where multiple caches store copies of the same data. This can lead to inconsistencies in the data if the caches are not kept coherent.

- If a cache can be made as large as the device for which it is caching, why not make it that large and eliminate the device?
- Making the cache as large as the device it is caching would eliminate the need for the device, but it would also introduce other problems:
- **Cost**: Making the cache as large as the device would increase the cost of the system significantly. Caches are expensive to manufacture, and making them as large as the device would make the system prohibitively expensive.
- **Complexity**: Large caches are more complex to design and implement, increasing the complexity of the system. This would make the system harder to maintain and debug.
- **Performance**: Large caches can introduce performance problems, such as cache thrashing, where the cache is constantly being invalidated and reloaded with new data. This can reduce the performance of the system significantly.
- **Power consumption**: Large caches consume more power, increasing the power consumption of the system. This can reduce the battery life of mobile devices and increase the operating costs of data centers.
- **Physical size constraints**: Cache is the CPU memory, it is not possible to make the cache as large as the disk.
