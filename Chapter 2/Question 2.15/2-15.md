# Question 2.15 #

What are the two models of interprocess communication? What are the
strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches?

# Answer #

**Message passing** is useful for exchanging
smaller amounts of data, because no conflicts need be avoided. It is also easier to implement than is shared memory for intercomputer communication.
**Shared memory** allows maximum speed and convenience of communication,
since it can be done at memory transfer speeds when it takes place within a
computer. Problems exist, however, in the areas of protection and synchronization between the processes sharing memory.
