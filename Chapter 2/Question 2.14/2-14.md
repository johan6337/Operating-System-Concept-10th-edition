# Question 2.14 #

Describe why Android uses ahead-of-time (AOT) rather than just-in-time
(JIT) compilation

# Answer #

- Faster app startup: Since the code is already compiled, apps can launch immediately without waiting for compilation.
- Better battery life: The device doesn't need to spend energy repeatedly compiling the same code.
- Improved performance: The compiler can spend more time optimizing the code during installation, resulting in better-performing apps.
- More predictable behavior: Since compilation happens once, app performance is more consistent across launches.
