# Question 2.16 #

Contrast and compare an application programming interface (API) and
an application binary interface (ABI).

# Answer #

- **API (Application Programming Interface)**:
- An API is a set of functions and procedures that allow applications to interact with an operating system, software library, or other services. 
- The API defines the methods and protocols that applications can use to communicate with the underlying system or service.
- APIs are typically defined at a higher level of abstraction and provide a more user-friendly interface for developers to work with.
- APIs are often language-specific and may include language-specific features and conventions.

- **ABI (Application Binary Interface)**:
- An ABI is a set of rules and conventions that define how functions, data structures, and system calls are represented in machine code.
- The ABI specifies the low-level details of how applications interact with the operating system and hardware.
- ABIs are typically defined at a lower level of abstraction and focus on the binary interface between software components.
- ABIs are platform-specific and define the binary interface for a particular hardware architecture and operating system.
