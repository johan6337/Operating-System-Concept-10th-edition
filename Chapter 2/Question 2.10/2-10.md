# Question 2.10 #

Describe three general methods for passing parameters to the operating
system.

# Answer #

Three general methods are used to pass parameters to the operating system. The simplest approach is to pass the parameters in registers. In some
cases, however, there may be more parameters than registers. In these cases,
the parameters are generally stored in a block, or table, in memory, and the
address of the block is passed as a parameter in a register. Linux
uses a combination of these approaches. If there are five or fewer parameters, 
registers are used. If there are more than five parameters, the block method is
used. Parameters also can be placed, or pushed, onto a stack by the program
and popped off the stack by the operating system. Some operating systems
prefer the block or stack method because those approaches do not limit the
number or length of parameters being passed.
