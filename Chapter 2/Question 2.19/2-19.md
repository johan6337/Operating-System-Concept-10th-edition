# Question 2.19 #

What is the main advantage of the microkernel approach to system
design? How do user programs and system services interact in a microkernel architecture? What are the disadvantages of using the microkernel approach?

# Answer #

- The most advantage of microkernel approach to system is:
- It is easier to extend a microkernel than it is to extend a monolithic kernel.
- It is easier to port an operating system to new architectures.
- It is more reliable (less code is running in kernel mode).
- It is more secure (less code is running in kernel mode).

- Communication is provided through message passing. User programs communicate with system services by sending messages to the microkernel, which then forwards the messages to the appropriate service. The services respond by sending messages back to the user programs.

- Unfortunately, the performance of microkernels can suffer due to increased
system-function overhead. When two user-level services must communicate,
messages must be copied between the services, which reside in separate 
address spaces. In addition, the operating system may have to switch from
one process to the next to exchange the messages
