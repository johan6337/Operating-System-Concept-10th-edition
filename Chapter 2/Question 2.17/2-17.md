# Question 2.17 #

Why is the separation of mechanism and policy desirable?

# Answer #

The separation of policy and mechanism is important for flexibility. Policies
are likely to change across places or over time. In the worst case, each change
in policy would require a change in the underlying mechanism. A general
mechanism flexible enough to work across a range of policies is preferable.
A change in policy would then require redefinition of only certain parameters
of the system.
