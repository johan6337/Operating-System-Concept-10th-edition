# Question 2.24 #

The experimental Synthesis operating system has an assembler incorporated in the kernel. To optimize system-call performance, the kernel
assembles routines within kernel space to minimize the path that the system call must take through the kernel. This approach is the antithesis of
the layered approach, in which the path through the kernel is extended
to make building the operating system easier. Discuss the pros and cons
of the Synthesis approach to kernel design and system-performance
optimization

# Answer #

- The Synthesis approach to kernel design and system-performance optimization has the following pros and cons:

- Pros:
- The Synthesis approach to kernel design and system-performance optimization is more efficient than the layered approach as it minimizes the path that the system call must take through the kernel.
- By incorporating an assembler in the kernel, the Synthesis operating system can optimize system-call performance by assembling routines within kernel space.
- The Synthesis approach can lead to faster system-call performance and improved overall system performance by reducing the overhead associated with system calls.

- Cons:

- The Synthesis approach to kernel design and system-performance optimization may be more complex and harder to maintain than the layered approach.
- The Synthesis approach may lead to a less modular and extensible kernel design, making it more challenging to add new features or modify existing ones.
- The Synthesis approach may sacrifice flexibility and ease of development for performance optimization, which could limit the system's adaptability to changing requirements or environments.
