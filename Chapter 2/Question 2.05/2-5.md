What are the disadvantages of the layered approach?

# Answer #

The main advantage of the layered approach to system design is that it provides a structured way to organize the system, making it easier to understand and modify. Each layer is independent of the layers above and below it, which allows for easier debugging, testing, and maintenance. 

The main disadvantages of the layered approach is performance which is slower than a monolithic kernel.
