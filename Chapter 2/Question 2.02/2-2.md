# Question 2.2 #

 What is the purpose of the command interpreter? Why is it usually
separate from the kernel?

# Answer #

- The command interpreter, also known as the shell, is responsible for
  interpreting and executing user commands into system calls. 

- The command interpreter is usually separate from the kernel because it is possible for users to develop a new command interpreter by using systems-call interface provided by the OS.
