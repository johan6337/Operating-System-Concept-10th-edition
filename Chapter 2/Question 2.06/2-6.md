# Question 2.6 #

List five services provided by an operating system, and explain how each
creates convenience for users. In which cases would it be impossible for
user-level programs to provide these services? Explain your answer

# Answer #

- **User Interface**: The operating system provides a user interface that allows users to interact with the computer system. This interface can be graphical, text-based, or command-line based, depending on the operating system. The user interface creates convenience for users by providing an intuitive way to interact with the system, allowing users to perform tasks without having to memorize complex commands or programming languages.

- **Program execution**: The operating system provides the ability to execute and load programs into memory. This service creates convenience for users by allowing them to run applications and software without having to manage the low-level details of memory management, process scheduling, and resource allocation. 

- **I/O operations**: The operating system provides services for input and output operations, such as reading from and writing to files, devices, and network connections. This service creates convenience for users by abstracting the complexities of interacting with hardware devices and providing a unified interface for performing I/O operations. This shouldnt be possible for user-level programs to provide these services because protection mechanisms are required to prevent unauthorized access to devices and system resources.

- **File-system manipulation**: The operating system provides services for creating, deleting, reading, and writing files on the file system. This service creates convenience for users by organizing and managing data in a structured manner, allowing users to store, retrieve, and share information easily.

- **Error detection**: The operating system provides error detection and recovery mechanisms to handle system failures, hardware faults, and software errors. This service creates convenience for users by ensuring the system remains stable and reliable, minimizing the impact of errors on user data and applications.
