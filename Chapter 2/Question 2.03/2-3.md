# Question 2.3 #

What system calls have to be executed by a command interpreter or shell
in order to start a new process on a UNIX system?

# Answer #

In order to start a new process on a UNIX system, the following system calls have to be executed by a command interpreter or shell:

1. **fork()**: This system call is used to create a new process by duplicating the calling process. The new process is called the child process, and the calling process is called the parent process.

2. **exec()**: This system call is used to replace the current process with a new process. The exec() system call loads a new program into the current process's memory space and starts its execution.

3. **wait()**: This system call is used by the parent process to wait for the termination of the child process. The parent process can use the wait() system call to retrieve the termination status of the child process.
