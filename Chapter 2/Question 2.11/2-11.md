# Question 2.11 #

Describe how you could obtain a statistical profile of the amount of time
a program spends executing different sections of its code. Discuss the
importance of obtaining such a statistical profile

# Answer #

To obtain a statistical profile of the amount of time a program spends executing different sections of its code, we can use the systems-call interface provided by the operating system such as `gettimeofday()` or `clock_gettime()`. These functions can be used to measure the time taken by a program to execute different sections of its code. By inserting these functions at the beginning and end of each section of code, we can calculate the time taken by each section and generate a statistical profile. Obtaining such a statistical profile is important because: 

- **Performance optimization**: By identifying the sections of code that are taking the
most time to execute, we can focus on optimizing those sections to improve the overall performance of the program.
