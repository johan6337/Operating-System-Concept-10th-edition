# Question 2.1 #

What is the purpose of system calls?

# Answer #

There are several main purposes of system calls: process control,
fil management, device management, information maintenance, communications, and protection.

**Process control**: The operating system must be able to create and delete both user and system processes, suspend and resume processes, provide mechanisms for process synchronization, and provide mechanisms for process communication.

**File management**: The operating system is responsible for file management, which includes creating and deleting files, opening and closing files, reading and writing files, and setting file attributes.

**Device management**: The operating system must manage the devices attached to the system, including allocating devices to processes, providing mechanisms for device communication, and providing mechanisms for device synchronization.

**Information maintenance**: The operating system must maintain information about the system, including the system time, system date, system configuration, and system status.

**Communications**: The operating system must provide mechanisms for communication between processes, including interprocess communication and network communication.

**Protection**: The operating system must provide mechanisms for protecting the system from unauthorized access, including user authentication, file permissions, and process permissions.
